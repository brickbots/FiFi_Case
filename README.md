Case files for a brass and acrylic FiFi

This repo contains the DXF and Fusion 360 files to build a case for the FiFi PCB:
https://github.com/raychengy/fifi_split_keeb

The case uses 7 layers of 3mm acrylic and one brass layer of ~1.5mm.  You'll need 2x of (almost) all of the DXF files in this repo:

* fifi_plate_v1.dxf - This is the brass top switchplate
* fifi_bottom_dplate_v1.dxf - This is an acrylic plate that can be used between the brass plate and PCB as a way to adjust the sound of the case
* fifi_bottom_d_v1.dxf - This is the same layer sits under the brass plate, but without the 'plate' part.  If you want to cut foam, or just have a gap between the brass plate and PCB use this file.  You only need one bottom_d layer for each half.
* You'll need one of each of the remaining layers for each half.  Top ones go above the brass plate, bottoms below. 

The holes in the acrylic are sized for 2mm standoffs ~15mm in length.  The brass screws are m2 and can be tricky to find.  I ended up ordering 100 of them fairly inexpensively from McMaster Carr (part #96741A013).
